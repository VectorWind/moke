# Moke

## Scope

This repository is for Moke to work out of. The goal is for members of Team Epsilon to guide Moke to grow his learning, gain real experience, and have a strong resume with security implementations for our projects. By doing so, Moke will continue with his education goals and have no trouble in getting a paid internship in the cybersecurity field to start off a exciting new career.

## Roadmap

The following list represents a syllabus of topics for Moke to explore. Each number corresponds to a folder in this repository that contains a `report.md` of what was learned as well as any notable code or configuration artifacts. Teammates will provide relevant learning resources such as blog posts or video series and review the folder materials before moving onto the next item.

At item #14 (inclusive), Moke can begin Team Epsilon project work in parallel.
